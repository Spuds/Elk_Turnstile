Turnstile is a free service that protects your site from spam and abuse.

Turnstile delivers frustration-free, CAPTCHA-free web experiences to website visitors. Turnstile stops abuse and confirms visitors are real without the data privacy concerns or awful user experience of CAPTCHAs.

To use Turnstile, you need to sign up for an API key pair for your site https://www.cloudflare.com/products/turnstile/ . The key pair consists of a site key and secret. The site key is used to display the widget on your site. The secret authorizes communication between your application backend and the Turnstile server to verify the user's response. The secret needs to be kept safe for security purposes.

To enter your API key go to your sites Admin -> Configuration -> Security and Moderation -> Anti-Spam section and find the Turnstile area.
